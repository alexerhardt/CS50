# Coursework for Harvard's Intro to Computer Science (CS50x)
This is my coursework for [Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science - CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).

All problem sets are presented as submitted to the course, unless noted otherwise. All problem sets received a grade of 1.0 (maximum grade possible). Programs often include skeleton code provided by the Harvard staff - all credit to them (for that and for providing an amazing teaching experience!)
